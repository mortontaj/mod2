      <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Upon graduation, I will be quant trading at a bank or asset management firm. I envision this vividly because I hedged commodities on a trade floor with my supervisor at Cargill years ago. Thanks to my internship experience and coach from Management Leadership for Tomorrow, I understand the sense of urgency and accuracy that traders must possess. Additionally, I envision passing the securities industry essentials exam, series 7 and series 57 within my first 6 - 8 months at the desk. I even reviewed half of the SIE study manual along with information from Investopedia for understanding technical jargon. Furthermore, I developed the habit to read market news articles from the Wall Street Journal, Barron’s, Bloomberg, and Yahoo Finance. And I am grateful Baruch introduced the WSJ free to undergrads. Most recently, I began my software engineering course at Per Scholas to streamline enhancing my programming and I completed Tim Buchalka’s Python Masterclass successfully. Through Per Scholas’ 15-week course, I am building websites, application programming interfaces, and other projects through JavaScript, React, JSON, HTML, and CSS. Thanks to my python dedication, I have fully completed all the test inputs for over twenty Python HackerRank function implementation challenges.

          I hold myself accountable for my professional development. I know exactly where I want to be, and I know the pinnacles I aspire to reach. I will be a great fit for this program because I harnessed my willpower to overcome any obstacles I encounter.
